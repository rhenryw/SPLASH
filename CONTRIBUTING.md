Contributing
---

SPLASH is an open source and community-forward project, and therefore we invite you to help us out!

I (rhw) am the main developer, but I can't have all of the code perfect nor all of the features, so if you know how to code and feel like contributing follow the steps below.

  1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/rhenryw/SPLASH/fork)
  2. Commit your code (Be descriptive in the commits!)
  3. Push and open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/rhenryw/SPLASH/pulls)
  4. Decsribe your changes and why you made them

I (or somebody else) will review and see what they think, if changes need to be made we will let you know what to change. If it all looks good your code will be pulled within 48 hours!
