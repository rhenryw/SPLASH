# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

It should be up to date EVERYWHERE due to the SPLASHP reverse proxy deploy method

Nobody except yourself is responible for anything that happens related to SPLASH or RHW (rhenryw)

3rd parties deploy versions of SPLASH that I am not responsible for. THE ONLY deployment that is official is `https://splash.best`. Non `http` and any subdomain of  `splash.best` is NOT included in official deployments.
